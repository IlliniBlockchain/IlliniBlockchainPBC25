# Aptos Developer Chatbot

This project is a chatbot (or “AI agent”) that answers Aptos developer questions in natural language. It is designed to provide relevant, accurate, and easy-to-digest answers by leveraging official Aptos documentation, GitHub repositories, and other trusted resources. The final deliverable is a working prototype built with a TypeScript-based chatbot UI (using Next.js) and a Flask-based backend powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

---

## Overview

**Objective:**  
- Create an Aptos-focused QA model that accurately addresses technical questions about Move smart contracts, tooling, deployments, and more without “hallucinating” unrelated content.
- Implement a user-friendly chatbot UI that fits seamlessly within existing Aptos documentation (e.g., embedding in [aptos.dev](https://github.com/aptos-labs/developer-docs)).
- Leverage RAG search techniques to pull answers directly from official Aptos docs and GitHub repositories, ensuring content fidelity.
- Enhance the user experience with features like suggested questions, conversation history, and brand-customized styling.

## Architecture and Components

### 1. Aptos-Focused QA Model

- **Backend AI Agents:**  
  The backend is built with Python using Flask and crewAI. It coordinates multiple specialized agents that search through various sources:
  - **Aptos Core Repository:** For implementation details and code examples.
  - **Aptos Full Stack Template:** For integration patterns and full-stack examples.
  - **Aptos Developer Documentation:** For technical guides, tutorials, and API references.
 
  **Sources:**
  - *'https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core'*
  - *'https://github.com/0xaptosj/aptos-full-stack-template'*
  - *'https://github.com/aptos-labs/developer-docs'*
  - *'https://learn.aptoslabs.com/'*
  - *'https://aptos.dev/'*
  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  The system uses RAG to ensure that responses are drawn directly from trusted, up-to-date Aptos sources, minimizing the risk of incorrect or irrelevant responses.

### 2. Chatbot UI

- **Built with Next.js and TypeScript:**  
  The frontend is crafted in TypeScript using Next.js to deliver a modern, responsive, and accessible chatbot interface.
- **User-Friendly Features:**  
  - **Suggested Questions:** UI buttons offer common developer queries like “How to deploy a Move module?” for quick interactions.
  - **Conversation History:** Users can refer back to previous queries, enhancing context and continuity in dialogues.
  - **Easy Integration:** The design and codebase provide a clear path to embedding the chatbot into existing Aptos documentation sites.

### 3. How It Works

- **Question Processing:**  
  When a developer asks a question, the chatbot sends a request to the backend via a REST API.
- **Backend Query Handling:**  
  The Flask server receives the query, orchestrates multiple research agents through crewAI, and uses RAG to fetch relevant data from Aptos docs, GitHub repos, and other sources.
- **Response Synthesis:**  
  Results are aggregated, formatted in markdown, and sent back to the UI where the chatbot displays the answer.
- **Maintaining Context:**  
  Conversation history is maintained to support follow-up questions, ensuring that context is preserved throughout the session.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend (aptos-ui):**  
  - **`app/page.tsx`:** Entry point for the Next.js app.
  - **`src/components/AptosAssistant.tsx`:** Implements the chatbot UI, including handling form input and displaying answers.
  - **UI Assets:** Styled with Tailwind CSS to match Aptos branding.

- **Backend (backend/aptos):**
  - **`src/aptos/main.py`:** Flask application exposing API endpoints such as `/ask` that handle incoming queries.
  - **`src/aptos/crew.py`:** Defines the AI agents and task orchestration using crewAI.
  - **`config/agents.yaml` and `config/tasks.yaml`:** YAML files configuring the roles, goals, and task definitions for each agent.

- **Documentation and Examples:**
  - **`report.md`:** Example output report generated by the system that answers an Aptos-related query.
  - **Test Scripts:** For instance, `test.py` to manually test the `/ask` endpoint.

## Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python (>=3.10, <3.13)
   - Required packages (installed via `pip` or using crewAI's dependency handling)
   - Create a `.env` file with necessary environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, GitHub tokens).

2. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the Backend:**
   ```bash
   python backend/aptos/src/aptos/main.py
   ```
   The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:8007](http://localhost:8007).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn)

2. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   cd aptos-ui
   npm install
   ```

3. **Running the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the chatbot.

## Documentation of Approach

- **Aptos-Specific Data Integration:**  
  The project integrates data directly from Aptos official resources, including the Aptos Core repo, Full Stack Template, and Aptos Developer Documentation. This integration ensures answers are based on the latest and most reliable information available.

- **Implementation of RAG:**  
  Retrieval-augmented generation is configured within the crewAI framework. Multiple research agents perform parallel searches over pre-configured data sources, aggregating and summarizing relevant excerpts to form the final answer.

- **Chatbot UI and Experience:**  
  The UI is designed to be straightforward and intuitive:
  - It accepts natural language queries.
  - Provides suggested questions via clickable buttons (e.g., “How to deploy a Move module?”).
  - Maintains a history of the conversation to preserve context.
  - Styled to align with Aptos's branding and aesthetics.

- **Potential Embed Integration:**  
  With its modular and API-driven design, the chatbot can be easily embedded into existing Aptos developer sites like [aptos.dev](https://github.com/aptos-labs/developer-docs) or adapted into other formats to enhance developer documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Persistence and User Management:**  
  Implement persistent conversation history with a database and add user authentication for personalized sessions.
- **Error Handling and Logging:**  
  Improve error management in both the backend and frontend for production readiness.
- **Expanded Sources:**  
  Incorporate additional data sources and research agents to cover more aspects of the Aptos ecosystem.
- **Brand Customization:**  
  Further align the look and feel with Aptos’s official branding, including logos, color schemes, and UI elements.

## Conclusion

The Aptos Developer Chatbot is a robust prototype aimed at demystifying complex technical queries about Aptos. By combining state-of-the-art RAG techniques, specialized research agents, and a responsive TypeScript-based UI, this project offers a clear integration path into existing Aptos docs and developer tools. It not only enhances the accessibility of Aptos-related information but also paves the way for future improvements in AI-driven developer support.

Happy coding and welcome to the future of Aptos developer support!
